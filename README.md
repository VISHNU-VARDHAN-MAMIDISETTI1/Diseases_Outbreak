# Disease Outbreak Prediction

## Overview
This project aims to predict disease outbreaks using machine learning techniques. It utilizes datasets related to diseases such as diabetes, heart disease, and Parkinson's disease and applies classification algorithms to determine potential health risks.

## Features
- Data preprocessing and analysis
- Machine learning model implementation
- Performance evaluation using accuracy metrics
- Utilization of SVM for diabetes classification
- Utilization of Random Forest for heart disease and Parkinson's disease classification
- SMOTE technique used for handling class imbalance
- Streamlit-based web application for user interaction

## Technologies Used
- Python
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- Streamlit
- Pickle

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/VISHNU-VARDHAN-MAMIDISETTI1/Diseases_Outbreak.git
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```sh
   pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn streamlit imbalanced-learn
   ```
3. Run the Streamlit application:
   ```sh
   streamlit run app.py
   ```

## Usage
- Load the trained models for diabetes, heart disease, and Parkinson's disease.
- Enter the required parameters in the Streamlit web interface.
- Click on the prediction button to get results.

## Contribution
Feel free to submit issues and pull requests to improve the model or add new features.
